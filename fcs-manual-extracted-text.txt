1.1 Program Overview
Wellpoint is the single third-party administrator (TPA) contracting with the Washington Health Care
Authority for the Foundational Community Supports (FCS) program. As the third-party administrator,
Wellpoint facilitates program implementation, enhances quality, supports providers and pays
claims.

The FCS program provides targeted Apple Health (Medicaid) benefits to assist eligible individuals
with complex health needs obtain and maintain stable housing and employment. These may
include any of the following:
• Coaching
• Advocacy
• Information and referral
• Linking and coordinating
• Ongoing supports


The project aims to identify the interrelation of health problems and housing stability. Homelessness
is cyclical and puts individuals/families at a greater risk for physical and mental health conditions
and substance use disorders. There is also substantial evidence linking unemployment to poor
physical and mental health outcomes, even in the absence of pre-existing conditions.

Employment is an important aspect of an individual’s well-being and quality of life. Supported
Employment assists people with disabilities to participate as much as possible in the competitive
labor market, working in a preferred job with the level of support and services needed to obtain and
maintain competitive employment in an integrated work setting.

The FCS program creates statewide, targeted home- and community-based services (HCBS)
intended to help Apple Health (Medicaid) beneficiaries with complex health needs transition to and
maintain community community-based housing and employment resources.

FCS services are provided according to an enrollee's choice and preference at all times, including
but not limited to choice of FCS provider, preference in housing community, and/or employer, and
preferences relating to service engagement. HCBS could be provided to enrollees under a 1915(i)
state plan amendment.

1.2 Supportive Housing Services

[Page 9]
Supportive Housing services help individuals who are experiencing homelessness or housing
instability live with maximum independence in community-integrated housing while
simultaneously bolstering their engagement in healthcare service.

Activities are intended to ensure successful community living through the utilization of skills training,
cueing, modeling and supervision as identified by the person-centered assessment. Services can be
provided flexibly, including in-person or on behalf of an individual.

Eligible Target Populations
Eligible populations for Supportive Housing services include individuals who are 16 or older and
meet needs-based criteria and at least one risk factor:
• Have at least one assessed health needs-based criteria and is expected to benefit from
    community support services:
    ‒ Mental health need where there is a need for improvement, stabilization or prevention of
        deterioration of functioning resulting from the presence of mental illness
    ‒ Need for outpatient substance use disorder treatment
    ‒ Need for assistance with three or more activities of daily living (ADL)
    ‒ Need for hands-on assistance with one or more activity of daily living (ADL)
    ‒ Complex physical health need — a long continuing or indefinite physical condition requiring
        improvement, stabilization or prevention of deterioration of functioning, including the ability
        to live independently without support
• Have at least one risk factor:
    ‒ Are chronically homeless as defined by the U.S. Housing and Urban Development. (see note
        below).
    ‒ History of frequent and/or lengthy stays in the settings defined in 24 CFR 578.3, or from a
        skilled nursing facility as defined in WAC 388-97-0001:
           • Frequent is defined as two or more contacts in the past 12 months.
           • Lengthy is defined as 90 or more consecutive days within an institutional care facility
    ‒ History of frequent adult residential care stays:
           • Frequent is defined as two or more contacts in the past 12 months.
           • Adult residential care, enhanced adult residential care, or assisted living facilities as
                defined in WAC 388-110-020
           • Adult family homes as defined in WAC 388-76-10000 o History of frequent turnover of
                in-home caregivers, where within the last 12 months the individual utilized three or
                more different in-home caregiver providers, and the current placement is not
                appropriate for the individual.
    ‒ Have a Predictive Risk Intelligence System (PRISM) score of 1.5 or above.

Note: This also includes individuals who previously met the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) definition of chronic homelessness but have been housed in the
last 60 days (Time housed may not exceed 60 days).

When billing, use this category of service: Supportive Housing services, per diem (code H0043).

[Page 10]
The recommendation is that each per diem code is for at least 60 minutes of services, including at
least one instance of face-to-face interaction with the enrollee. Supportive Housing services will
reflect a commitment to principles and philosophy of service including:
•   Tenant choice. Supportive Housing tenants will be able to choose where they want to live.
    −   Tenants cannot be evicted from their housing for rejecting services, disenrolling from FCS
        services or for changing FCS service provider
•   Access. Supportive Housing units will be available to people who are experiencing
    homelessness, are precariously housed and/or who have multiple barriers to housing stability,
    including disabilities and substance abuse.
•   Quality. Supportive Housing units will be similar to other units in the community.
•   Integration. Supportive Housing tenants with disabilities will have a right to receive housing and
    supportive services in the most integrated settings available.
•   Independent, permanent housing. Supportive Housing tenant leases or subleases will confer full
    rights of tenancy, including limitations on landlords’ entry into the property and the right to
    challenge eviction in landlord-tenant court. Tenants can remain in their homes as long as the
    basic requirements of the lease are met.
•   Affordability. Supportive Housing must meet tenants’ affordability standards.
•   Coordination between housing and services. Property managers and support service staff will
    stay in regular communication and coordinate their efforts to help prevent evictions and to
    ensure tenants facing eviction have access to necessary services and supports.
•   Delineated roles. There will be a functional separation of roles, with the housing elements (rent
    collection, property maintenance, enforcement of tenancy responsibilities) carried out by
    different staff than those providing services.

Community Support Services
Community support services (CSS) are services that support individuals with 1) their ability to
prepare for and transition to housing, including direct and collateral services, and 2) maintaining
tenancy once housing is secured. Collateral services include work such as external care
coordination, housing search, landlord engagement on behalf of a specific individual.

Activities include the following:

•   Pre-tenancy supports
•   Conducting a functional needs assessment identifying the enrollee’s preferences related to
    housing (for example, type, location, living alone or with someone else, identifying a roommate,
    accommodations needed, or other important preferences) and needs for support to maintain
    community integration (including what type of setting works best for the enrollee), assistance in
    budgeting for housing/living expenses, assistance in connecting the individual with social
    services to assist with filling out applications and submitting appropriate documentation in
    order to obtain sources of income necessary for community living and establishing credit, and in
    understanding and meeting obligations of tenancy
•   Assisting individuals to connect with social services to help with finding and applying for
    housing necessary to support the individual in meeting their medical care needs

[Page 11]
•   Developing an individualized community integration plan based on the functional needs
    assessment as part of the overall person-centered plan
•   Identifying and establishing short and long-term measurable goal(s), how goals will be
    achieved, and how concerns will be addressed
•   Participating in person-centered plan meetings at redetermination and/or revision plan
    meetings, as needed
•   Providing supports and interventions per the person-centered plan


Tenancy-sustaining services
• Providing service-planning support and participating in person-centered plan meetings at
   redetermination and/or revision plan meetings as needed
•   Coordinating and linking the recipient to services including primary care and health homes;
    substance use treatment providers; mental health providers; medical, vision, nutritional and
    dental providers; vocational, education, employment and volunteer supports; hospitals and
    emergency rooms; probation and parole; crisis services; end of life planning; and other support
    groups and natural supports
•   Providing entitlement assistance including obtaining documentation, navigating and
    monitoring the application process, and coordinating with the entitlement agency
•   Assisting with accessing supports to preserve the most independent living, such as individual
    and family counseling, support groups, and natural supports
•   Providing supports to assist the individual in the development of independent living skills, such
    as skills coaching, financial counseling and anger management
•   Providing supports to assist the individual in communicating with the landlord and/or property
    manager regarding the participant’s disability (if authorized and appropriate), detailing
    accommodations needed, and addressing components of emergency procedures involving the
    landlord and/or property manager
•   Coordinating with the tenant to review, update and modify his or her housing support and crisis
    plan on a regular basis to reflect current needs and address existing or recurring housing
    retention barriers
•   Connecting the individual to training and resources that will assist the individual in being a
    good tenant and lease compliance, including ongoing support with activities related to
    household management


CSS Minimum Service Levels
CSS encounters are based on a daily rate with a benefit limitation of 30 days over a 180-day
authorization period. Any additional time within that 180-day period needs to be authorized as an
exception by FCS staff.

CSS Exclusions
The CSS benefit is intended to reimburse for supportive housing services only. It does not include:

[Page 12]
•   Payment of rent or other room and board costs.
•   Capital costs related to the development or modification of housing.
•   Expenses for utilities or other regularly occurring bills.
•   Goods or services intended for leisure or recreation.
•   Duplicative services from other state or federal programs.
•   Services to individuals in a correctional institution.
•   Any other expenses not related to the direct provision of CSS


Note: CSS may not be provided or billed prior to an authorization for service.

Telephone Contact
Telephone calls of at least 15 minutes are billable. Whenever possible and appropriate, face-to-face
contact with the enrollee should be prioritized. For enrollee contacts, phone calls should not
represent the primary means of engagement, and we may reject claims that show an overreliance
on phone contact that results in reduced quality of service to the enrollee. Video conferences and
video calls are considered face-to-face contact. Text messages and email communications are not
billable.

Reauthorization for CSS services
Community Support Services are designed to provide ongoing follow-along supports when
necessary. An FCS supportive housing enrollee can reenroll for additional 180-day authorization
periods of CSS services using the same health need and risk factor used for initial enrollment.

1.3 Supported Employment Services

Supported Employment services assist those individuals who want to work and meet FCS criteria to
become employed in integrated community employment. Activities are intended to ensure
successful employment outcomes through the utilization of collateral contacts, skills training,
cueing, modeling and supervision as identified by the person-centered assessment.

Individualized Supported Employment services include: identifying career and occupational targets,
developing ongoing relationships with prospective employers, assisting with the interviewing and
hiring process, and, once employed, support with maintaining employment. Coaching and skill-
building of interpersonal relationships in the work setting as well as education for self-advocacy
and support with the American with Disabilities Act are also included.

Individual Placement and Support
Individual Placement and Support (IPS) are services that help eligible individuals obtain and
maintain stable employment. IPS services are based on the following principles and philosophy:
•   Competitive employment is the goal, and providers help enrollees obtain competitive jobs.
    Competitive employment is defined as: paying at least minimum wage and the wage others

[Page 13]
    receive, performing the same work based in community settings alongside others without
    disabilities, and not reserved for people with disabilities.
•   IPS supported employment is integrated with other behavioral and social services. IPS
    supported employment services are closely integrated with the plan of care. When applicable,
    providers are members of multidisciplinary teams that meet regularly to review enrollee
    progress. Discussions include clinical and rehabilitation information that is relevant to work,
    such as medication side effects, persistent symptoms, cognitive difficulties or other
    rehabilitation needs.
•   They share information and develop ideas to help enrollees improve their functional recovery.
•   There is zero exclusion. Eligibility is based on enrollee choice; every covered person who wants
    to work is eligible for IPS supported employment regardless of psychiatric or other diagnosis,
    symptoms, work history, or other problems, including substance abuse and cognitive
    impairment. The core philosophy of IPS supported employment is that all persons with a
    disability can work at competitive jobs in the community without prior training, and no one
    should be excluded from this opportunity. Agencies develop a culture of work so all
    practitioners encourage enrollees to consider working.
•   Services are based on enrollees’ preferences and choices rather than providers’ judgments.
    Enrollee preferences help determine the type of job that is sought, the nature of support
    provided by the employment specialist and team, and whether to disclose the aspects of a
    person's psychiatric disability to the employer.
•   Benefits counseling is important. Providers help enrollees access ongoing guidance regarding
    Social Security, Apple Health (Medicaid), government entitlements, and other benefits. Fear of
    losing benefits is a major reason enrollees may not want to seek employment. It is vital that
    enrollees obtain accurate information and guidance on how income from employment could
    impact state and federal benefits, so they can make informed decisions about changes in
    wages and work hours. Providers who do not provide direct benefits counseling services are
    encouraged to subcontract with providers who can provide benefits counseling services.
•   The job search should be rapid. Providers help enrollees seek jobs directly rather than providing
    extensive pre-employment assessment and training or intermediate work experiences.
    Beginning the job search process early (in other words, within 30 days) demonstrates to
    enrollees their desire to work is taken seriously and conveys optimism that there are multiple
    opportunities available in the community for enrollees to achieve their vocational goals.
•   Job development is systematic. Providers develop relationships with employers based on their
    enrollees’ work preferences by meeting face-to-face over multiple visits. Providers learn about
    the work environment and the employers’ work needs. They find out about jobs they may not be
    aware of at employment sites. They gather information about the nature of job opportunities
    and assess whether they may be a good job fit. Providers continue to make periodic visits
    because networking is how people find jobs.
•   Support should be time-unlimited. Follow-along supports are individualized and continued for
    as long as the enrollee wants and needs the support. IPS specialists and other members of the
    treatment team provide work support. In addition, they look for natural supports (for example,
    family member, coworker) that would be available over time. The goal is to help the enrollee

[Page 14]
    become as independent as possible in his or her vocational role while providing support and
    assistance as needed. Once a person has worked steadily (for example, one year), they discuss
    transitioning from IPS.


FCS Supported Employment Exclusions
FCS supported employment services are intended to reimburse for the provision of supported
employment services only. They do not include:
•   Generalized employer contacts that are not connected to a specific enrolled individual or an
    authorized service.
•   Employment support for individuals in subminimum or sheltered workshop settings,
•   Facility-based habilitation or personal care services.
•   Wage or wage enhancements/supplements for individuals.
•   Duplicative services from other state or federal programs.
•   Any other expenses not a direct supported employment service.


Note: Supported employment may not be provided or billed prior to an intake and authorization for
service.

Telephone Contact
Telephone calls of at least 15 minutes are billable. Whenever possible and appropriate, face-to-face
contact with the enrollee should be prioritized. For enrollee contacts, phone calls should not
represent the primary means of engagement, and we may reject claims that show an overreliance
on phone contact that results in reduced quality of service to the enrollee. Video conferences and
video calls are considered face-to-face contact. Text messages and email communications are not
billable.

Eligible Target Populations
The individual is at least 16 years of age and meets at least one of the following health needs-
based criteria and is expected to benefit from IPS:

    1. Enrolled in the state Housing and Essential Needs (HEN), or Aged, Blind or Disabled (ABD)
       Program. (Please provide the reward letter.)
    2. The individual is assessed to have a behavioral health need, which is defined as one or both
       of the following:

           b. Substance use needs, where an assessment using the American Society of Addiction
               Medicine (ASAM) criteria indicates the individual meets at least ASAM level 1.0, which
               indicates the need for outpatient substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. The ASAM
               is a multidimensional assessment approach for determining an individual’s need for
               SUD treatment.

[Page 15]
    3. The individual is assessed to have a need for assistance, demonstrated by the need for one

              0010, one of which may be body care
           b. Hands-on assistance with one or more ADLs, one of which may be body care.
       i. There is objective evidence (as defined by the progressive evaluation process in Chapter

          understanding and following instructions, responding appropriately to supervisors and
          coworkers, tolerating the pressures of a work setting, maintaining appropriate behavior,
          using judgment, and adapting to changes in a routine work setting.


    4. And the individual has at least one of the following risk factors:

       1.   Unable to be gainfully employed for at least 90 consecutive days due to a mental or
            physical impairment as demonstrated by eligibility for the Aged, Blind and Disabled
            (ABD) program or the Housing and Essential Needs (HEN) program
       2.   Inability to obtain or maintain employment resulting from age, physical disability or
            traumatic brain injury
       3.   More than one instance of inpatient substance use treatment in the past two years

            more of the following:
            a. Behaviors that disrupt employment or schooling or put employment at risk of
                termination or schooling suspension
            b. A history of multiple terminations from work or suspensions/expulsions from school
            c. Cannot succeed in a structured work or school setting without additional support or

•   (H2023) Pre-employment services — activities that assist an individual with obtaining
    employment.

[Page 16]
•   (H2025) Employment-sustaining services — activities that support the individual in retaining and
    maintaining employment.

 Supported Employment Minimum Service Levels
Pre-employment and employment-sustaining services are based on 15-minute units that are limited
to 120 units over a 180-day period. Any additional time within that 180-day period needs to be
authorized as an exception to rule (ETR) by FCS staff.

Collateral services include work such as external care coordination, employer outreach (for highest
fidelity, Individual Placement and Support (IPS) only recognizes employer outreach that is done
face to face), work incentive planning and benefit education, and supported education activities
such as communicating with college counselors or program staff of other educational programs on
behalf of a specific individual.

Pre-Employment Services and Employment-Sustaining Services
Pre-employment services support an individual’s ability to prepare for and transition to competitive
employment, including direct face-to-face contact with the enrollee as well as collateral service.

Pre-employment services include the following:
• Prevocational/job-related discovery or assessment
•   Person-centered employment planning
•   Individualized job development and placement
•   Job carving — defined as working with the enrollee and employer to modify an existing job
    description so it contains one or more, but not all, of the tasks from the original job description
    when a potential applicant for a job is unable to perform all the duties identified in the job
    description
•   Benefits education and planning — defined as counseling to assist the enrollee in fully
    understanding the range of state and federal benefits they might be eligible for, the
    implications that work and earnings would have for continued receipt of these benefits, and the
    enrollee’s options for returning to work
•   Transportation (only in conjunction with the delivery of an authorized service)

Employment-sustaining services include the following:
• Career advancement services — defined as services that expand opportunities for professional
  growth, assist with enrollment in higher education or credentialing and certificate programs to
  expand job skills or enhance career development, and assist the individual in monitoring his/her
  satisfaction with employment and determining the level of interest and opportunities for
  advancement with the current employer, and/or changing employers for career advancement
•   Negotiation with employers — defined as services where a provider identifies and addresses
    job accommodations or assistive technology needs with the employer on behalf of the
    individual
•   Job accommodations can include the following:

[Page 17]
    −   Adjusting work schedule to reduce exposure to triggering events (in other words, heavy
        traffic triggering symptoms of agoraphobia)
    −   Providing a private area for individuals to take breaks if they experience an increase in
        symptoms
    −   Access to a telephone to contact a support person if needed while at work

    understanding the range of state and federal benefits he or she might be eligible for, the
    implications that work and earnings would have for continued receipt of these benefits, and the
    enrollee’s options for returning to work
•   Transportation (only in conjunction with the delivery of an authorized service)
•   Asset development — defined as services supporting enrollee’s accrual of assets that have the
    potential to help enrollees improve their economic status, expand opportunities for community
    participation and positively impact their quality of life experience.
    −   Assets are defined as something with value owned by an individual, such as money in the
        bank, property and retirement accounts.
•   Follow-along supports — defined as the ongoing supports necessary to assist an eligible
    enrollee to sustain competitive work in an integrated setting of his or her choice
    −   This service is provided for, or on behalf of, an enrollee and can include communicating with
        the enrollee’s supervisor or manager, whether in the presence of the enrollee or not (if
        authorized and appropriate). There is regular contact and follow-up with the enrollee and
        employer to reinforce and stabilize job placement. Follow-along support and/or
        accommodations are negotiated with an employer prior to the enrollee starting work or as
        circumstances arise.
Additionally, it’s important to engage in individualized job development services that support
individuals in searching for and securing a job in the community such as:
•   Identifying and negotiating jobs.

[Page 18]
•   Customized employment development, job analysis and job carving.
    Linking with community resources to support job search.
Benefits Planning and Counseling

If your agency does not directly provide benefits education, planning and counseling services,
Wellpoint can assist you in connecting with an agency that does provide these services. If requested,
we can provide a sample agreement for subcontracting with a benefits planner.

Reauthorization for supported employment services
FCS supported employment services are designed to provide ongoing follow-along supports when
necessary. An FCS supported employment enrollee can reenroll for additional 180-day authorization
periods of IPS services using the same health need and risk factor used for initial enrollment
without need for revalidation of health need and risk factor as long as the enrollee continues to
need these services.

844-451-2828. Alternatively, the enrollee can complete a Provider Change Request form and email it
to FCSTPA@Wellpoint.com or mail it to FCS:

                                              FCS TPA
                                     705 Fifth Ave. S., Suite 300
                                        Seattle, WA 98104

Provider Change Request forms must be signed by the FCS enrollee to be considered valid. All
documentation relating to a voluntary provider change must be maintained in an enrollee’s file,
and it is subject to review during Wellpoint ’s Quality Assurance (QA) process.


3.4 Exception to Rule/Limited Extension Requests
Additional supported employment or supportive housing units above the initial units authorized
during an enrollee’s period of authorization may be requested for enrollees when the enrollee has
used up most of their units and if it is clinically necessary. Providers can submit an Exception to
Rule/Limited Extension Request (ETR) Form along with a signed Single Case Agreement Form and
supporting documentation to be considered for additional units.

The following supporting documentation and explanations should accompany each ETR
request:
• Progress notes (from authorization start date to present)
•   A description and supporting documentation explaining why it is clinically necessary for this
    enrollee to receive more units during the current authorization period
•   A description of services that have been tried and their outcomes
•   The enrollee’s person-centered plan for employment/housing
•   A description of the additional services that will be needed (number of additional units needed
    for current authorization period)
•   The level of improvement the enrollee has shown to date related to FCS services and what
    improvements could be reasonably expected if more FCS services are approved for current
    authorization period
•   How a enrollee’s condition might worsen if more FCS services are not approved

[Page 24]
•   Completed and signed FCS TPA Single Case Agreement Form


The Single Case Agreement Form confirms that Wellpoint authorizes the provider to provide
services required by the Wellpoint FCS TPA program based on the terms and conditions set forth for
the specific episode of care.


3.5 Disenrollment
Enrollees can be disenrolled from the FCS program at any time. To officially disenroll, an enrollee
can complete the online Disenrollment Form. This form can be found on the FCS provider site, under
the Forms section. The form must be signed by the enrollee indicating their consent to disenroll in
FCS services.

Alternatively, the enrollee may call the FCS Program Line at 844-451-2828 to request disenrollment.
Providers cannot request voluntary termination on behalf of an enrollee, but may submit a request
for involuntary disenrollment due to inactivity.

Possible Disenrollment Reasons
The enrollee:
•   Requested the disenrollment.
•   Is deceased.
•   Has moved out of state.
•   Lost Apple Health (Medicaid) eligibility.
•   No longer meets criterion for FCS services.
•   Meets the criteria for Involuntary Disenrollment due to Inactivity.


Enrollees who lose Apple Health (Medicaid) eligibility will be automatically disenrolled.

Involuntary Disenrollment Due to Inactivity
When a contracted FCS provider is unable to engage an inactive FCS enrollee after multiple
attempts, an FCS provider may disenroll the participant from FCS services following the
standardized procedures below. This process includes the submission of the FCS Disenrollment
Form due to inactivity by a contracted FCS provider to Wellpoint after the provider takes the steps
outlined below.


When a wet signature is not obtainable, contracted FCS providers may only disenroll an enrollee
when the following due diligence terms are met:

•   At least four attempts at contacting the inactive FCS enrollee must occur over a minimum of six
    weeks or longer.
    – Each attempt at contacting an enrollee must:
        • Occur at least one week apart from one another,

[Page 25]
       • Occur on different days of each week and at different times of the day (to maximize the
         opportunities for making contact), and
       • Be documented in the enrollee’s file.


•   At least two methods of communication must be utilized when attempting to contact the
    inactive FCS enrollee.
    − Approved forms of attempted contact include:
       • In-person
       • Phone
       • Email
       • Letter


Note: While text messages and collateral contacts are not sufficient methods of attempted contact,
they can be used to initiate contact with an enrollee so that an approved form of contact can be
used.

After the due diligence terms are met, the contracted FCS provider may submit the FCS
Disenrollment Form due to inactivity located on the Wellpoint FCS provider website. All
documentation relating to disenrollments must be maintained in an enrollee’s file, and it is subject
to review during Wellpoint ’s Quality Assurance (QA) process. The FCS Provider must attest to
having completed their Due Diligence prior to initiating the disenrollment process.

All disenrolled enrollees may submit a Request for Reconsideration to Wellpoint through their
former FCS provider (FCSTPA@Wellpoint.com) within 30 days of the date of their disenrollment if
they feel they’ve been inappropriately disenrolled.

Disenrolling inactive FCS enrollees is not mandatory. If an FCS enrollee is inactive due to
incarceration, inpatient treatment, or for any other reason that warrants keeping them enrolled,
please do so.

Each disenrollment will result in a disenrollment start date effective on the first calendar day of the
following month.

Involuntary Termination of Enrollment
If an enrollee becomes ineligible due to a change in eligibility status or functional need, his or her
enrollment will be terminated as follows:
•   If it’s processed on or before the HCA cut-off date for enrollment or Wellpoint is informed by HCA
    of the enrollment termination prior to the first day of the month following the month in which it’s
    processed by HCA, the termination will be effective the first day of the month following the
    month in which the enrollment termination is processed by the HCA.
•   If it’s processed after the HCA cut-off date for enrollment and Wellpoint is not informed by HCA
    of the enrollment termination prior to the first day of the month following the month in which it’s

[Page 26]
        processed by HCA, the termination will be effective the first day of the second month following
        the month in which the enrollment termination is processed by the HCA.


 Notification forms with a disenrollment effective date for the first of the month will be processed for
 the last date of the previous month (for example, a December 1 effective date will be processed for
 November 30).

 3.6 Enrollment Pause and Waitlist

 FCS is a pilot program with a limited budget. This budget is primarily driven by the number of
 enrollments and engaged enrollees in each month. Each year, HCA submits a Decision Package to
 the Governor’s Office and the Office of Financial Management. Decision Packages provide updated,
 projected enrollments and service utilization trends based on historical data.
 When FCS enrollment reaches budgetary limits, enrollment of new enrollees may be paused. Current
 enrollees may be re-authorized for and receive additional services, as long as they remain eligible
 for FCS services. During an enrollment pause, the FCS program will have a 30-day window for
 reauthorizing individuals (after their authorization has expired). If an FCS reauthorization
 assessment is received more than 30 days after an authorization has expired, an enrollee will not
 be reauthorized for services. Instead, they will be placed on the waitlist.
 If eligible for the other service, currently authorized enrollees may be enrolled in the other service
 type (in other words, supported employment services, supportive housing services).

 New enrollees will not be enrolled or denied but will instead be placed on a waitlist. The waitlist is
 on a first-come, first-served basis, under Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 182-559-100 based
 on the date and time an assessment is received. Enrollment will reopen when the number of
 enrollees reaches the forecasted enrollment target numbers for a given month. As space becomes
 available, Wellpoint will evaluate the new assessments from the waitlist and follow the standard
 documentation and eligibility determination process.

    (MFCU) and state auditor, CMS, auditors from the federal Government Accountability Office,
    federal Office of the Inspector General, federal Office of Management and Budget, the Office of
    the Inspector General, the Comptroller General, and their designees, to access, inspect and
    audit any records or documents of the subcontractors, and must permit inspection of the
    premises, physical facilities and equipment where Medicaid-related activities or work is
    conducted at any time. Providers will make copies of records and deliver them to the requestor,
    without cost, within 30 calendar days of the request. The right for the parties named above to
    audit, access and inspect under this section exists for 10 years from the final date of the contract
    period or from the date of completion of any audit, whichever is later.


Wait Times
Wellpoint will have contracts in place with FCS providers to ensure access to services are provided
appropriately, taking into account the urgency of the need for services. Wellpoint will ensure:
•   Network providers offer access comparable to that offered to commercial members and/or
    Medicaid fee-for-service members.
•   Mechanisms are established to ensure compliance by providers.
•   Providers are monitored regularly to determine compliance.
•   Corrective action is initiated and documented if there is a failure to comply.
•   In-office wait time for scheduled appointments should not routinely exceed 45 minutes including
    time in the waiting room. Each enrollee should be notified immediately if the provider is delayed
    for any period of time. If the appointment wait time is anticipated to be more than 45 minutes,
    the enrollee should be offered a new appointment. Walk-in enrollees should be seen if possible
    or scheduled for an appointment consistent with written scheduling procedures.

      single sign-on to access ProviderOne. ProviderOne is how you will view your clients’ Medicaid
      eligibility and FCS enrollment.

4.3 Quality Monitoring and Reporting
Providers must:
•   Participate in scheduled training, fidelity reviews, peer review and quality assurance review
    processes and reporting as specified by FCS program requirements.
•   Establish and carry out quality improvement activities.

[Page 32]
•   Follow Wellpoint policies and procedures for the FCS program.
•   Submit a monthly report on the form provided by Wellpoint by the 10th of the following month.
•   Share records with Wellpoint to show demonstrated capacity of the organization to provide
    FCS services if requested.
•   Agree to a physical inspection of any facility or site where FCS services are performed or FCS
    records are kept if requested.
FCS providers are responsible for establishing a continuous quality improvement program. This
includes collecting and reporting on data that permits an evaluation of goal achievement on
individual-level clinical outcomes, experience-of-care outcomes and quality-of-care outcomes at the
population level.


Fidelity reviews/assessments measure whether a program operates according to standardized
practices. Fidelity assessments use objective rating systems (also called tools, measures, or
instruments) with instructive protocols to determine the extent to which program components
adhere to established models, theories, or philosophies. The fidelity measures developed for
consumer operated services enable program leaders to pinpoint program departures from
standard practices and models (Holter, Mowbray, Bellamy, MacFarlane & Dukarski, 2004; Johnsen,
Teague & McDonel-Herr, 2005). Research findings to date indicate that fidelity assessments should
be used to inform strategic planning, staff training, program development, and other quality
improvement initiatives.


Quality Management and Outcomes
Quality management is the act of overseeing all activities and tasks needed to maintain a desired
level of excellence. This includes creating and implementing quality planning, assurance, control
and improvement and fidelity reviews.

FCS providers are responsible for quality improvement activities that promote objective and
systematic measurement, monitoring and evaluation of services. Activities include:
•   Adhering to the Evidence-based practices of Supportive Housing ( SAMHSA EBP of PSH) and
    Supported Employment (IPS model).
•   Establishing a consistent framework for measuring and reporting housing and employment
    outcomes at the individual and overall program level.
•   Ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of FCS services via quality measures.
•   Assisting in monitoring compliance with program requirements.
•   Maintaining compliance with program standards as well as local, state and federal regulatory
    requirements.
•   Participation in Wellpoint access and availability surveys.


Quality improvement teams and methodology are used to develop processes and protocols that
result in improved outcomes. Placing an emphasis on the importance of establishing a culture of

[Page 33]
continuous improvement is a foundational element of your organization’s success in meeting
defined quality performance measures.

                                                Study



Supportive Housing services are intended to reduce homelessness and increase housing stability.
Importantly, Supportive Housing services seek to engage the enrollee in self-care and personal
management by establishing a personalized housing services plan that is holistic and reflective of
his or her preferences and goals. Quality factors consider engagement and access to housing and
tenure in housing. An initial quality initiative might track the engagement rate of individuals
attributed to FCS and those who become active participants.

FCS providers must develop means to track Supportive Housing services outcomes that show
expected program goals are met. Such data elements may cover but are not limited to:
•   Number of days from intake to placement in housing.
•   Number of days housed in the last 90 days, 180 days, etc.
•   Tenure in current housing situation.
•   Tenure in the program.
•   Number of days hospitalized in the last 90 days.
•   Number of hospitalizations in the last 90 days.
•   Number of days spent in jail in the last 90 days.
•   Mental-health functioning (where applicable).
•   Social functioning.
•   Self-reported quality of life.
•   Self-reported enrollee satisfaction.
•   Number of times rehoused.


Supported Employment services are intended to enhance individual’s participation in the
community and increase individual’s confidence and sense of self-worth. Importantly, supported

[Page 34]
employment services seek to engage the individual in self-care and personal management by
establishing a personalized employment services plan that is holistic and reflective of the enrollee’s
preferences and goals. Quality factors consider engagement and access to competitive
employment and maintenance of stable employment.

FCS providers must develop means to track supported employment services outcomes that show
expected program goals are met. The FCS program will work with providers on common definitions
and specifications. Such data elements may cover but are not limited to:
• Number of days from intake to placement in competitive employment.
•   Number of days employed in the last 90 days, 180 days, etc.
•   Tenure in current employment.
•   Tenure in the program.
•   Housing status.
•   Number of days hospitalized in the last 90 days.
•   Number of hospitalizations in the last 90 days.
•   Number of days spent in jail in the last 90 days.
•   Mental-health functioning (where applicable).
•   Social functioning.
•   Self-reported quality of life.
•   Self-reported enrollee satisfaction.
•   Number of work days and hours.
•   Wages earned.
•   Number of jobs.


Provider Outcome and Capacity Reports are due before the 10th of every month. This information is
crucial in illustrating the effectiveness of the FCS program to the State of Washington and Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The capacity data is needed for us to know which
providers are accepting external referrals. A link to the monthly outcome and capacity report can
be found on the FCS provider website.

Upon request, Wellpoint will make available the QM program description and information on our
progress towards meeting quarterly plans and goals.


4.4 Fraud, Waste and Abuse
We are committed to protecting the integrity of our healthcare program and the effectiveness of our
operations by preventing, detecting and investigating fraud, waste and abuse. Combating fraud,
waste and abuse begins with knowledge and awareness.

[Page 35]
•   Fraud: Any type of intentional deception or misrepresentation made with the knowledge that
    the deception could result in some unauthorized benefit to the person committing it -- or any
    other person. This includes any act that constitutes fraud under applicable Federal or State law.
•   Waste: Includes overusing services, or other practices that, directly or indirectly, result in
    excessive costs. Waste is generally not considered to be driven by intentional actions, but rather
    occurs when resources are misused.
•   Abuse: behaviors that are inconsistent with sound financial, business and medical practices and
    result in unnecessary costs and payments for services that are not medically necessary or fail to
    meet professionally recognized standards for healthcare. This includes any enrollee actions that
    result in unnecessary costs.


To help prevent fraud, waste and abuse, Providers can assist by educating enrollees. For example,
spending time with enrollees and reviewing their records for prescription administration will help
minimize drug fraud. One of the most important steps to help prevent Enrollee fraud is as simple as
reviewing the enrollee identification card. It is the first line of defense against possible fraud. Learn
more at fighthealthcarefraud.com.

Presentation of an enrollee identification (ID) card does not guarantee eligibility; Providers should
verify an enrollee’s status by inquiring online or via telephone. Online support is available for
Provider inquiries on the website, and telephonic verification may be obtained through the
automated Provider Inquiry Line at 833-731-2274.

Providers should encourage enrollees to protect their ID cards as they would a credit card, to carry
their health benefits card at all times, and report any lost or stolen cards to the company as soon as
possible. Understanding the various opportunities for fraud and working with enrollees to protect
their health benefit ID card can help prevent fraudulent activities. Providers should instruct their
patients who have lost their ID card to inspect their explanation of benefits (EOBs) for any errors and
then contact Member Services if something is incorrect.

Reporting Fraud, Waste and Abuse
If you suspect a Provider (for example, Provider group, hospital, doctor, dentist, counselor, medical
supply company, etc.) or any enrollee (a person who receives benefits) has committed fraud, waste
or abuse, you have the right to report it. No individual who reports violations or suspected fraud and
abuse will be retaliated against for doing so. The name of the person and their information, if
supplied, who reports the incident is kept in strict confidence by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU).

You can report your concerns by:
• Visiting our fighthealthcarefraud.com education site; at the top of the page, select “Report it”
   and complete the “Report Waste, Fraud and Abuse” form
•   Calling Customer Service:
•   Calling our SIU fraud referral hotline: 866-847-8247

[Page 36]
Any incident of fraud, waste or abuse may be reported to us anonymously; however, our ability to
investigate an anonymously reported matter may be handicapped without enough information.
Hence, we encourage you to give as much information as possible. We appreciate your time in
referring suspected fraud, but be advised that we do not routinely update individuals who make
referrals as it may potentially compromise an investigation.

As an alternative, allegations of fraud can also be reported directly to the Washington Health Care

Examples of Provider Fraud, Waste and Abuse (FWA):
• Altering medical records to misrepresent actual services provided
•   Billing for services not provided
•   Billing for medically unnecessary tests or procedures
•   Billing professional services performed by untrained or unqualified personnel
•   Misrepresentation of diagnosis or services
•   Overutilization
•   Soliciting, offering or receiving kickbacks or bribes
•   Unbundling – when multiple procedure codes are billed individually for a group of procedures
    which should be covered by a single comprehensive procedure code
•   Upcoding – when a Provider bills a health insurance payer using a procedure code for a more
    expensive service than was actually performed


When reporting concerns involving a provider (a doctor, dentist, counselor, medical supply company,
etc.) include:
• Name, address and phone number of provider (for example, the doctor(s) name(s), the hospital,
    nursing home, home health agency, etc.)
•   Medicaid number of the Provider and facility, if you have it

[Page 37]
•   Type of Provider (doctor, dentist, therapist, pharmacist, etc.)
•   Names and phone numbers of other witnesses who can help in the investigation
•   Dates of events
•   Summary of what happened


Examples of Member Fraud, Waste and Abuse
• Forging, altering or selling prescriptions
•   Letting someone else use the Enrollee’s ID (identification) card
•   Relocating to out-of-service Plan area and not notifying us
•   Using someone else’s ID card


When reporting concerns involving an enrollee include:
• The enrollee’s name
•   The enrollee’s date of birth, Provider One ID number, or Member ID number if you have it
•   The city where the enrollee resides
•   Specific details describing the fraud, waste or abuse


Investigation Process
Our Special Investigations Unit (SIU) reviews all reports of Provider or Member fraud, waste and
abuse for all services. If appropriate, allegations and the investigative findings are reported to all
appropriate state, regulatory and/or law enforcement agencies. In addition to reporting, we may
take corrective action with Provider fraud, waste or abuse, which may include, but is not limited to:
• Written warning and/or education: We send certified letters to the Provider documenting the
    issues and the need for improvement. Letters may include education or requests for recoveries
    or may advise of further action.
•   Medical record review: We review medical records in context to previously submitted claims
    and/or to substantiate allegations.
•   Prepayment Review: A certified professional coder evaluates claims prior to payment of
    designated claims. This edit prevents automatic claim payment in specific situations.
•   Recoveries: We recover overpayments directly from the Provider. Failure of the Provider to
    return the overpayment may result in reduced payment of future claims and/or further legal
    action.


If you are working with the SIU all checks and correspondence should be sent to:
Special Investigations Unit
740 W Peachtree Street NW
Atlanta, Georgia 30308
Attn: investigator name, #case number

[Page 38]
Paper medical records and/or claims are a different address, which is supplied in correspondence
from the SIU and is also available in other sections of this manual. If you have questions, contact
your investigator. An opportunity to submit claims and/or supporting medical records electronically
is an option if you register for an Availity account. Contact Availity Client Services at 800-AVAILITY
(282-4548) for more information.

About Prepayment Review
One method we use to detect FWA is through prepayment Claim review. Through a variety of means,
certain Providers (Facilities or Professionals), or certain Claims submitted by Providers, may come to
our attention for behavior that might be identified as unusual for coding, documentation and/or
billing issues, or Claims activity that indicates the Provider is an outlier compared to his/her/its
peers.

Once a Claim, or a Provider, is identified as an outlier or has otherwise come to our attention for
reasons mentioned above, further review may be conducted by the SIU to determine the reason(s)
for the outlier status or any appropriate explanation for unusual coding, documentation, and/or
billing practices. If the review results in a determination the Provider’s action(s) may involve FWA,
unless exigent circumstances exist, the Provider is notified of their placement on prepayment review
and given an opportunity to respond.

When a Provider is on prepayment review, the Provider will be required to submit medical records
and any other supporting documentation with each Claim so the SIU can review the
appropriateness of the services billed, including the accuracy of billing and coding, as well as the
sufficiency of the medical records and supporting documentation submitted. Failure to submit
medical records and supporting documentation in accordance with this requirement will result in a
denial of the Claim under review. The Provider will be given the opportunity to request a discussion
of his/her/its prepayment review status.

Under the prepayment review program, we may review coding, documentation, and other billing
issues. In addition, one or more clinical utilization management guidelines may be used in the
review of Claims submitted by the Provider, even if those guidelines are not used for all Providers
delivering services to FCS enrollees.

The Provider will remain subject to the prepayment review process until the health plan is satisfied
that all inappropriate billing, coding, or documentation activity has been corrected. If the
inappropriate activity is not corrected, the Provider could face corrective measures, up to and
including termination from the network at the direction of the State.

Providers are prohibited from billing an enrollee for services the health plan has determined are not
payable as a result of the prepayment review process, whether due to FWA, any other coding or
billing issue or for failure to submit medical records as set forth above. Providers whose Claims are
determined to be not payable may make appropriate corrections and resubmit such Claims in
accordance with the terms of their Provider Agreement, proper billing procedures and state law.
Providers also may appeal such a determination in accordance with applicable grievance and
appeal procedures.

[Page 39]
Acting on Investigative Findings
If, after investigation, the SIU determines a Provider appears to have committed fraud, waste, or
abuse the Provider:
• May be presented to the credentials committee and/or peer review committee for disciplinary
     action, including Provider termination
•   Will be referred to other authorities as applicable and/or designated by the State
•   The SIU will refer all suspected criminal activity committed by an enrollee or Provider to the
    appropriate regulatory and law enforcement agencies.


Failure to comply with program policy or procedures, or any violation of the contract, may result in
termination from our plan.

If an enrollee appears to have committed fraud, waste or abuse or has failed to correct issues, the
enrollee may be involuntarily dis-enrolled from the FCS program with state approval.

Offsets.
Wellpoint shall be entitled to offset claims and recoup an amount equal to any overpayments
(“Overpayment Amount”) or improper payments made by the health plan to Provider or Facility
against any payments due and payable by the health plan to Provider or Facility with respect to
any Health Benefit Plan under any contract with our company regardless of the cause. Provider or
Facility shall voluntarily refund the Overpayment Amount regardless of the cause, including, but not
limited to, payments for Claims where the Claim was miscoded, non-compliant with industry
standards, or otherwise billed in error, whether or not the billing error was fraudulent, abusive or
wasteful. Upon determination by the health plan that an Overpayment Amount is due from Provider
or Facility, Provider or Facility must refund the Overpayment Amount within the timeframe specified
in letter notifying the Provider or Facility of the Overpayment Amount. If the Overpayment Amount is
not received within the timeframe specified in the notice letter, the health plan shall be entitled to
offset the unpaid portion of the Overpayment Amount against other Claims payments due and
payable by Wellpoint to Provider or Facility under any Health Benefit Plan in accordance with
Regulatory Requirements. Should Provider or Facility disagree with any determination, Provider or
Facility shall have the right to appeal such determination under Wellpoint procedures set forth in
this Provider Manual, on condition that that such appeal shall not suspend Wellpoint’s right to
recoup the Overpayment Amount during the appeal process unless required by Regulatory
Requirements. Wellpoint reserves the right to employ a third-party collection agency in the event of
non-payment.

Privacy, Confidentiality and Compliance
We’re committed to safeguarding enrollee information. As a contracted provider, you must have
procedures in place to demonstrate compliance with Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy regulations. You must also have safeguards to protect enrollee
information, such as locked cabinets clearly marketed and containing only protected health
information (PHI).

HIPAA:

[Page 40]
•   Improves the portability and continuity of benefits.
•   Providers greater member rights to access and privacy.
•   Ensures greater accountability in healthcare fraud.
•   Simplifies the administration of health insurance.


Enrollee individual privacy rights include the right to:
• Receive a copy of provider notice of privacy practices.
•   Request and receive a copy of his or her treatment records and request those records be
    amended or corrected.
•   Get an accounting of certain disclosures of his or her PHI.
•   Ask that his or her PHI not be used or shared.
•   Ask each provider to communicate with him or her about PHI in a certain way or location.
•   File a complaint with his or her provider or the Secretary of Health and Human Services if
    privacy rights are suspected to be violated.
•   Designate a personal representative to act on his or her behalf.
•   Authorize disclosure of PHI outside of treatment, payment or healthcare operations and cancel
    such authorizations.


We only request the minimum enrollee information necessary to accomplish our purpose. Likewise,
you should only request the minimum enrollee information necessary for your purpose. However,
regulations do allow the transfer or sharing of enrollee information to:
•   Conduct business and make decisions about care.
•   Make an authorization determination.
•   Resolve a payment appeal.


Requests for such information fit the HIPAA definition of treatment, payment, or healthcare
operations.

42 CFR Part 2 Compliance
When providers use, disclose, maintain, or transmit PHI protected by 42 CFR Part 2, they
acknowledge and agree that in receiving, storing, processing or otherwise dealing with any such
records for enrollees, they are fully bound by 42 CFR Part 2. If necessary, they will resist any efforts to
obtain access to such records except as permitted under 42 CFR Part 2. Providers also acknowledge
and agree that any patient information they receive that is protected by 42 CFR Part 2 is subject to
protections that prohibit providers from disclosing such information to agents or subcontractors
without the specific written consent of the enrollee.

4.5 Data Sharing and Transfers

[Page 41]
Providers will participate with and provide data to Wellpoint to facilitate program monitoring and
evaluation. The form and content of data transfer will be developed. Data elements may include
but not be limited to:
•   Eligibility determinations.
•   Service utilization.
•   Grievances and appeals.
•   Enrollee incidents (critical incidents).
•   Outcome measures (such as days in housing and employment status).


Reports
Wellpoint will create a data dashboard. The dashboard will collect and maintain de-identified data
on enrollees and service usage and provide fully detailed reports to HCA monthly. Required data
includes but may not be limited to: regionally based utilization, number of enrollees receiving
services, number of enrollees housed or employed, number of enrollees on any waitlist for services,
service dollars spent, eligibility determinations, and grievances and appeals.

In addition, FCS providers are required to provide the data elements related to the services they are
contracted for so the elements needed for quality monitoring and oversight may be reported.
Additional reports will include but are not limited to the following:
•   HCA-requested data
•   Cost experience data reporting
•   Data security and certification
•   Enrollee records (with onsite inspection)
•   Care plan assessment
•   Delegated entity monitoring
•   Breach notifications
•   Enrollee incidents
•   Enrollee outcomes, including the following:
    −   Number and percentage of enrollees housed in the community after 30 and 90 calendar
        days following service initiation; longevity in housing
    −   Number and percentage of enrollees engaged in employment-seeking activities, supported
        employment
        • Number and percentage of enrollees in integrated and competitive employment;
          longevity of competitive employment
•   Enrollee voice and experience — measures satisfaction with services and providers, interpreter
    utilization, and culturally appropriate activities to support enrollee understanding of services

[Page 42]
•   Employment — measures hours worked per week, employer-sponsored benefits and increase in
    personal income
•   Housing — measures length of time to achieve housing placement, number and percentage
    remaining in housing after 12 months, number of enrollees receiving CSS essential services by
    type
•   (for example, rental deposit, furnishings), and other indicators available (for example, through
    the Homeless Management Information System [HMIS])
•   Access — measures the wait time an enrollee experiences to receive service(s), duration of time
    an enrollee remains in service(s) and referrals made for applicants who are ineligible for FCS
•   Enrollee stability — measures enrollees having reduced contact with law enforcement,
    increased social connectedness and decreases in acute healthcare utilization
•   Health services utilization — measures emergency room and inpatient utilization and total
    healthcare costs


Additional reports may be created as identified through ongoing collaboration with Wellpoint, HCA
and DSHS.


4.6 Grievances, Appeals and Discrimination
Only an enrollee or enrollee’s authorized representative may file a grievance with Wellpoint. A
provider may not file a grievance on behalf of an enrollee unless the provider is acting on behalf of
the enrollee and has the enrollee’s written consent.

The FCS program follows WAC 182-559-600 for appeal processes.

Enrollees who contact us with an allegation of discrimination are informed immediately of their
right to file a grievance. This also occurs when a Wellpoint representative working with an enrollee
identifies a potential act of discrimination. We advise the enrollee to submit a verbal or written
account of the incident and assist them in doing so if he or she requires assistance. We document,
track and trend all alleged acts of discrimination.

Enrollees are also advised to file a civil rights complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR):
•   Through the OCR complaint portal at ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/smartscreen/main.jsf
•   By mail to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 200 Independence Ave SW, Room
    509F, HHH Building, Washington, DC 20201.
•   By phone at 800-368-1019 (TTY/TDD: 800-537-7697).


Wellpoint provides tools and services at no cost to those with disabilities to communicate effectively
with us. Wellpoint also provides no-cost language services to people whose primary language isn’t
English (for example, qualified interpreters and information written in other languages). These
services can be obtained by call 844-451-2828.

[Page 43]
If you or your enrollee believe that Wellpoint has failed to provide services or discriminated in any
way on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, disability, gender or gender identity, you can file
a grievance with us via:
•   Mail: 705 5th Ave South, Suite 300, Seattle, WA 98104
•   Email: FCSTPA@Wellpoint.com
•   Phone: 844-451-2828
•   Fax: 844-470-8859


4.7 Equal Program Access on the Basis of Gender
Wellpoint provides individuals with equal access to programs and activities without discriminating
on the basis of gender. Wellpoint must also treat individuals consistently with their gender identity
and is prohibited from discriminating against any individual or entity on the basis of a relationship
with, or association with, an enrollee of a protected class (in other words, race, color, national origin,
gender, gender identity, age or disability).

Wellpoint may not deny or limit services that are ordinarily or exclusively available to individuals of
one gender, to a transgender individual based on the fact that a different gender was assigned at
birth or because the gender identity or gender recorded is different from the one in which health
services are ordinarily or exclusively available.


4.8 Support and Training for Providers
Wellpoint will provide regular trainings for FCS providers. All FCS provider groups are expected to
participate. Wellpoint will maintain records of the number and type of providers, agencies and
support staff participating in provider education, including evidence of assessment of participation
satisfaction from the training process. It is also recommended that all FCS providers connect with
the DBHR FCS training team for ongoing technical assistance and training around Supportive
Housing and Supported Employment services and the fidelity of the FCS program. For more
information, please email Employment_Assistance@hca.wa.gov or
Housing_Assistance@hca.wa.gov.




5. BILLING AND CLAIMS SUBMISSION

5.1 Provider Reimbursement
FCS services are managed by Wellpoint. FCS providers contract with Wellpoint and are reimbursed
based on the Health Care Authority fee schedule for FCS services.

[Page 44]
For additional information or updates, see the Washington Health Care Authority’s Medicaid
transformation FCS webpage at hca.wa.gov/about-hca/programs-and-initiatives/medicaid-
transformation-project-mtp/housing-and-employment


5.2 Claims Submission
FCS providers are encouraged to submit FCS claims electronically. However, Wellpoint will work with
FCS providers on a claims submission process based on provider resources and technological
capabilities.

Three billing codes are reimbursed for FCS services:
• Supportive Housing services:
      −   H0043 Community Support services: daily rate of $112 with a benefit limitation of 30 days
          over a 180-day period. Any additional time within that 180-day period would need to be
          authorized as an exception by FCS staff.
•     Supported Employment services:
      −   H2023 Pre-Employment services: supported employment, per unit of 15 minutes
      −   H2025 Employment Sustaining services: ongoing supports to maintain employment, per unit
          of 15 minutes
      −   Both H2023 and H2025 have a rate of $27 per unit and a benefit limitation of 120 units over a
          180-day period. Additional time required above this benefit limitation within the 180-day
          period would need to be authorized as an exception by FCS staff.

5.5 Provider and Facility Digital Guidelines
Wellpoint understands that working together digitally streamlines processes and optimizes
efficiency. We developed the Provider and Facility Digital Guidelines to outline our expectations and
to fully inform Providers and Facilities about our digital platforms.

Wellpoint expects Providers and Facilities will utilize digital tools, unless otherwise prohibited by
law or other legal requirements.

Digital guidelines establish the standards for using secure digital Provider platforms (websites) and
applications when transacting business with Wellpoint. These platforms and applications are
accessible to both participating and nonparticipating Providers and Facilities and encompass
Availity.com, electronic data interchange (EDI), electronic medical records (EMR) connections and
business-to-business (B2B) desktop integration.
The Digital Guidelines outline the digital/electronic platforms Wellpoint has available to
participating and nonparticipating Providers and Facilities who serve its Members. The expectation
of Wellpoint is based on our contractual agreement that Providers and Facilities will use these
digital platforms and applications, unless otherwise mandated by law or other legal requirements.
Digital and/or electronic transaction applications are accessed through these platforms:
   •   Availity EDI Clearinghouse
   •   B2B application programming interfaces (APIs)
   •   EMR connections
Digital guidelines available through Availity Essentials include:
   •   Acceptance of digital ID cards

[Page 46]
    •   Eligibility and benefit inquiry and response
    •   Prior authorization submissions including updates, clinical attachments, authorization
        status, and clinical appeals
    •   Claim submission, including attachments, claim status
    •   Remittances and payments
    •   Provider enrollment
    •   Demographic updates
Additional digital applications available to Providers and Facilities include:
   • Pharmacy prior authorization drug requests
    •   Services through Carelon Medical Benefits Management, Inc.
    •   Services through Carelon Behavioral Health, Inc.
Wellpoint expects Providers and Facilities transacting any functions and processes above will use
available digital and/or electronic self-service applications in lieu of manual channels (paper, mail,
fax, call, chat, etc.). All channels are consistent with industry standards. All EDI transactions use
version 5010.

Note: As a mandatory requirement, all trading partners must currently transmit directly to the
Availity EDI gateway and have an active Availity Trading Partner Agreement in place. This
includes providers using their practice management software & clearinghouse billing vendors.
Providers and Facilities who do not transition to digital applications may experience delays when
using non-digital methods such as mail, phone, and fax for transactions that can be conducted
using digital applications.

Section 1: Accepting digital ID cards
As our Members transition to digital Member ID cards, Providers and Facilities may need to
implement changes in their processes to accept this new format. Wellpoint expects that Providers
and Facilities will accept the digital version of the member identification card in lieu of a physical
card when presented. If Providers and Facilities require a copy of a physical ID card, Members can
email a copy of their digital card from their smartphone application, or Providers and Facilities may
access it directly from Availity Essentials through the Eligibility and Benefits Inquiry application.

Section 2: Eligibility and benefits inquiry and response
Providers and Facilities should leverage these Availity Clearinghouse hosted channels for electronic
eligibility and benefit inquiry and response:
• EDI transaction: X12 270/271 – eligibility inquiry and response
    −   Wellpoint supports the industry standard X12 270/271 transaction set for eligibility and
        benefit inquiry and response as mandated by HIPAA.
•   Availity Essentials

[Page 47]
    −   The Eligibility and Benefits Inquiry verification application allows a Provider and Facility to
        key an inquiry directly into an online eligibility and benefit look-up form with real-time
        responses.
•   Provider desktop integration via B2B APIs
    −   Wellpoint has also enabled real-time access to eligibility and benefit verification APIs that
        can be directly integrated within participating vendors’ practice management software,
        revenue cycle management software and some EMR software. Contact Availity for available
        vendor integration opportunities.
Section 3: Prior authorization submission, attachment, status, and clinical appeals.
Providers and Facilities should leverage these channels for prior authorization submission, status
inquiries and to submit electronic attachments related to prior authorization submissions:
•   EDI transaction: X12 278 – prior authorization and referral:
    −   Wellpoint supports the industry standard X12 278 transaction for prior authorization
        submission and status inquiry as mandated per HIPAA.
•   EDI transaction: X12 275 – patient information, including HL7 payload for authorization
    attachments:
    −   Wellpoint supports the industry standard X12 275 transaction for electronic transmission of
        supporting authorization documentation including medical records via the HL7 payload.
•   Availity Essentials:
    −   Authorization applications include the Availity Essentials multi-payer Authorization and
        Referral application for authorization submissions not accepted through Availity Essentials’
        multi-payer application.
        • Both applications enable prior authorization submission, authorization status inquiry and
          the ability to review previously submitted authorizations.
•   Provider desktop integration via B2B APIs:
    −   Wellpoint has enabled real-time access to prior authorization APIs, which can be directly
        integrated within participating vendors’ practice management software, revenue cycle
        management software and some EMR software. Contact Availity for available vendor
        integration.

Section 4: Claims: submissions, claims payment disputes, attachments, and status
Claim submissions status and claims payment disputes
Providers and Facilities should leverage these channels for electronic Claim submission,
attachments (for both pre- and post-payment) and status:
•   EDI transaction: X12 837 – Professional, institutional, and dental Claim submission (version 5010):

Section 5: Electronic remittance advice and electronic claims payment
Electronic remittance advice
Electronic remittance advice (ERA) is an electronic data interchange (EDI) transaction of the
explanation of payment of your claims. Wellpoint supports the industry standard X12 835
transaction as mandated per HIPAA.
Providers and Facilities can register, enroll and manage ERA preference through Availity.com.
Printing and mailing remittances will automatically stop thirty (30) days after the ERA enrollment
date.
• Viewing an ERA on Availity Essentials is under Claims & Payments, Remittance Viewer. Features
    of remittance viewer, include the ability to search a two (2) year history of remittances and
    access the paper image.
•   Viewing a portable document format (PDF) version of a remit is under Payer Spaces which
    provides a downloadable PDF of the remittance.

[Page 49]
To re-enable receiving paper remittances, contact Provider Services.

Electronic claims payment
Electronic claims payment is a secure and fast way to receive payment, reducing administrative
processes. There are several options to receive claims payments electronically.
•   Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)
Electronic funds transfer (EFT) uses the automated clearinghouse (ACH) network to transmit
healthcare payments from a health plan to a Provider’s or Facility’s bank account at no charge for
the deposit. Health plans can use a Provider’s or Facility’s banking information only to deposit
funds, not to withdraw funds. The EFT deposit is assigned a trace number (TRN) to help match the
payment to the correct 835 electronic remittance advice (ERA), a process called reassociation.


To enroll in EFT: Providers and Facilities can register, enroll, and manage account changes for EFT
through EnrollSafe at enrollsafe.payeehub.org. EnrollSafe enrollment eliminates the need for paper
registration. EFT payments are deposited faster and are generally the lowest cost payment
method. For help with enrollment, use this convenient EnrollSafe User Reference Manual.
To disenroll from EFT: Providers and Facilities are entitled to disenroll from EFT.
Disenroll from EFT payments through EnrollSafe at enrollsafe.payeehub.org.
•   Virtual Credit Card (VCC)
For Providers and Facilities who don’t enroll in EFT, and in lieu of paper checks, Wellpoint is shifting
some reimbursements to virtual credit card (VCC). VCC allow Providers and Facilities to process
payments as credit card transactions. Check with your merchant processor regarding standard
transaction fees that will apply.
Note that Wellpoint may receive revenue for issuing a VCC.

Opting out of virtual credit card payment. Providers and Facilities are entitled to opt out of
electronic payment. To opt out of virtual credit card payment, there are two (2) options:
    − Enrolling for EFT payments automatically opts you out of virtual credit card payments. To
       receive EFT payments instead of virtual credit cards payments, enroll for EFT through
       EnrollSafe at enrollsafe.payeehub.org.
           OR
    −   To opt out of virtual credit card payments, call 800-833-7130 and provide your taxpayer
        identification number.
•   Zelis Payment Network (ZPN) electronic payment and remittance combination
The Zelis Payment Network (ZPN) is an option for Providers and Facilities looking for the additional
services Zelis can offer. Electronic payment (ACH or VCC) and Electronic Remittance Advice (ERA) via
the Zelis portal are included together with additional services. For more information, go to
Zelis.com. Zelis may charge fees for their services.
Note that Wellpoint may receive revenue for issuing ZPN.
ERA through Availity is not available for Providers and Facilities using ZPN.

To disenroll from ZPN payment, there are two (2) options:

[Page 50]
    −   Enrolling for EFT payments automatically removes you from ZPN payments. To receive EFT
        payments instead of ZPN payments, enroll for EFT through EnrollSafe at
        enrollsafe.payeehub.org.
           OR
    −   To disenroll from ZPN payments, update your Zelis registration on the Zelis provider portal
        or contact Zelis at 877-828-8770.
Not being enrolled for EFT, VCC, or ZPN will result in paper checks being mailed.

    for medical necessity.


We will adjudicate clean claims to a paid or denied status within 30 calendar days of receipt. If we
do not pay the claim within 61 calendar days, we will pay all applicable interest as required by law.
The EOP shows the status of each claim that has been adjudicated during the previous claim cycle.

If we do not receive all of the required information, we will deny the claim either in part or in whole
within 30 calendar days of receipt of the claim. A request for the missing information will appear on
your EOP.

Once we have received the requested information, we will process the claim within 30 calendar
days.

EDI or practice management vendor. If you have any questions regarding paid, denied or pended
claims, call Provider Services at 833-731-2274.


5.10 Overpayment Process
Claims Overpayment Recovery Procedure
Wellpoint Payment Integrity Division reviews claims for accuracy and request refunds if claims are
overpaid or paid in error. Some common reasons for overpayments are, but not limited to:
• Paid wrong provider / enrollee
•   Coordination of Benefits
•   Allowance overpayments
•   Late credits
•   Billed in error
•   Duplicate
•   Non-covered services
•   Claims editing
•   Terminated enrollees
•   Total charge overpaid
•   Paid wrong enrollee / provider number


Refund notifications may be identified by Wellpoint and its contracted vendors or the providers.
Wellpoint researches and notifies the provider of an overpayment and requests a refund check. The
provider may also identify an overpayment and proactively submit a refund check to reconcile the
overpayment amount.

Wellpoint Identified Overpayment (aka “Solicited”)
Once an overpayment has been identified by Wellpoint, Wellpoint will notify the provider of the
overpayment. The overpayment notification letter will include instructions on how to refund the
overpayment. When refunding on a claim overpayment that Wellpoint has requested, use the
payment coupon included on the request letter and the following information with the check:
• The payment coupon
•   Enrollee ProviderOne ID number
•   Enrollee’s name
•   Claim number

[Page 54]
•   Date of service

•   Reason for the refund as indicated in the refund request letter


As indicated in the Wellpoint refund request letter, provider overpayment refunds not received and
applied within the timeframe indicated will result in claim recoupment from any claim the provider
submits to Wellpoint.

Providers wishing to submit an overpayment dispute for a solicitated overpayment recoupment
request, can submit their request via Availity, by mail, or fax.

The mailing address and fax number are:
Cost Containment — Disputes
PO Box 62427
Virginia Beach, VA. 23466-2437
Fax - 866-920-1874

The processing time once these documents are received is 30 days.

Providers submitting a refund check, should mail the refund to the address below and include a
copy of the overpayment letter received, a list of claims are being refunded and the refund amount
to be applied to each claim to:

Wellpoint
PO Box 933657
Atlanta, GA. 31193-3657

Provider Self-Identified Overpayments (aka “voluntary” or “unsolicited”)
To ensure compliance with contractual requirement 12.5.4.3 and 42 CFR 438.608(d)(2), Wellpoint
outlines below our documented mechanism for a Network Provider to report to the Contractor when
it has received an overpayment, return the overpayment to the Contractor within sixty (60) calendar
days after the date on which the overpayment was identified, and notify the Contractor in writing of
the reason for the overpayment.

If a provider identifies an overpayment and submits a refund, a completed Overpayment Refund
Notification Form specifying the reason for the return must be included. This form can be found on
the provider website at provider.wellpoint.com/washington-provider/resources/forms under the
Claims & Billing tab. The submission of the Overpayment Refund Notification Form will allow Cost
Containment to process and reconcile the overpayment in a timely manner. The provider can also
complete a Recoupment Notification Form, which gives Wellpoint the authorization to adjust claims
and create claim offsets. This form can also be found on the provider website at
provider.wellpoint.com/washington-provider/resources/forms. For questions regarding the refund
notification procedure, call Provider Services at 833-731-2274 and select the appropriate prompt.

All provider self-identified overpayment requests must be submitted in writing via US mail, fax, or
web submission.

Submission options:
USPS Mail:                   Cost Containment – Recoupments
                             P.O. Box 62427
                             Virginia Beach, VA 23466

Web submission:              Availity — Availity.com



All requests should include the following information:
• Name of Provider
•   Tax ID
•   NPI
•   Enrollee’s full name
•   Enrollee’s ProviderOne ID
•   List of claims
•   Reason for recoupment
•   Amount of recoupment
•   Include any supporting documentation to validate the reason for the recoupment.
•   Signature authorizing the recoupment.


Provider Self-Identified overpayment request turnaround time: Within 30 days of receipt.
*Incomplete requests will cause a delay in processing or the closure of the request with no further
action.

Changes to the overpayment process have taken place with the passage of the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), commonly known as the Healthcare Reform Act. The provision
directly links the retention of overpayments to false claim liability. The language of 42 U.S.C.A 1320a-
7k makes it explicit that overpayments must now be reported and returned to states or the
respective managed care organization (MCO) within 60 days of identification of the overpayment
or by the date any corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later. After 60 days, the
overpayment is considered a false claim, which triggers penalties under the False Claims Act,
including treble damages. In order to avoid such liability, healthcare providers and other entities
receiving reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid should implement policies and procedures on
reporting and returning overpayments that are consistent with the requirements in the PPACA.

The provision entitled Reporting and Returning Overpayments – Deadline for Reporting and
Returning Overpayments, codified at 42 U.S.C.A. 1320a-7k, clarifies the uncertainty left by the 2009
Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act. This provision of the Healthcare Reform Act applies to
providers of services, suppliers, Apple Health (Medicaid) MCOs, Medicare Advantage organizations,
and Medicare Prescription Drug Program sponsors. It does not apply to beneficiaries.

[Page 56]
Documentation of Claim Receipt
The following information will be considered proof that a claim was received timely. If the claim is
submitted:
•   By U.S. mail (first class, return receipt requested or by overnight delivery service): The provider
    must provide a copy of the claim log that identifies each claim included in the submission.
•   Electronically: The provider must provide the receipt date from the response reports.
•   By fax: The provider must provide proof of transmission.
•   By hand delivery: The provider must provide a claim log that identifies each claim included in
    the delivery and a copy of the signed receipt acknowledging the hand delivery.


The claims log maintained by providers must include the following information:
•   Name of claimant
•   Address of claimant
•   Phone number of claimant
•   Claimant’s federal tax identification number
•   Name of addressee
•   Name of carrier
•   Designated address
•   Date of mailing or hand delivery
•   Subscriber name
•   Subscriber ID number
•   Enrollee name
•   Date(s) of service/occurrence
•   Total charge
•   Delivery method


Good Cause
If the claim or claim dispute includes a written explanation clearly identifying the delay or other
evidence that establishes the reason, Wellpoint will determine good cause based primarily on that
statement or evidence and/or if the evidence leads to doubt about the validity of the statement.
Wellpoint will contact the provider for clarification or additional information necessary to make a
good cause determination.

Good cause may be found when a provider claim filing delay was due to:
•   Administrative error — incorrect or incomplete information furnished by official sources (for
    example, carrier, intermediary, CMS) to the provider.

[Page 57]
•   Incorrect information furnished by the enrollee to the provider, resulting in erroneous filing with
    another care management organization plan or with the state.
•   Unavoidable delay in securing required supporting claim documentation or evidence from one
    or more third parties, despite reasonable efforts by the provider to secure such documentation
    or evidence.
•   Unusual, unavoidable or other circumstances beyond the provider’s control, which demonstrate
    the provider could not reasonably be expected to have been aware of the need to file timely.
•   Destruction or other damage of the providers records, unless such destruction or other damage
    was caused by the provider’s willful act of negligence.


Corrected Claims
When submitting a correction for a previously billed claim on a CMS 1500 form, include all services
on the new submission. If any previously submitted changes or services are not billed on the
corrected claim form, they will be removed in the adjustment. Any reduction in payment would
result in a negative account balance and/or a refund request. Wellpoint does not accept individual
lines for correction on a CMS 1500 form; this mirrors the process for institutional replacement claims
submitted on CMS 1450 claim forms. Standard timely filing guidelines apply to all corrected and
replacement claims.


5.11 Provider Claim Payment Dispute Procedures
Claim Inquiries
A question about a claim or claim payment is called an inquiry. Inquiries do not result in changes to
claim payments, but the outcome of the claim inquiry may result in the initiation of the claim
payment dispute. In other words, once you get the answer to your claim inquiry, you may opt to
begin the claim payment dispute process.

Our Provider Experience program helps you with claim inquiries. Just call 833-731-2274 and select the
claims prompt within our voice portal. We connect you with a dedicated resource team, called the
Provider Service Unit (PSU) to ensure:
•   Availability of helpful, knowledgeable representatives to assist you.
•   Increased first-contact, issue resolution rates.
•   Significantly improved turnaround time of inquiry resolution.
•   Increased outreach communication to keep you informed of your inquiry status.


The PSU is available to assist you in determining the appropriate process to follow for resolving your
claim issue.

The provider payment dispute process consists of two steps. You will not be penalized for filing a
claim payment dispute, and no action is required by the enrollee.


5.12 Claim payment reconsideration

[Page 58]
This is the first step in the provider payment dispute process. The reconsideration represents your
initial request for an investigation into the outcome of the claim. Most issues are resolved at the
claim payment reconsideration step.

We will consider reimbursement of a claim that has been denied due to failure to meet timely filing
if you can 1) provide documentation the claim was submitted within the timely filing requirements
or 2) demonstrate good cause exists.


5.13 Claims Payment Reconsideration
The first step in the claim payment dispute process is called the reconsideration. It is your initial
request to investigate the outcome of a finalized claim. Please note, we cannot process a
reconsideration without a finalized claim on file.

We accept reconsideration requests in writing, verbally and through our secure provider website
within 24 months from the date on the EOP (see below for further details on how to submit).
Reconsiderations filed more than 24 months from the EOP will be considered untimely and denied
unless good cause can be established.

When submitting reconsiderations, please include as much information as you can to help us
understand why you think the claim was not paid as you would expect. If a reconsideration requires
clinical expertise, the appropriate clinical Wellpoint professionals will review it.

Wellpoint will make every effort to resolve the claims payment reconsideration within 30 calendar
days of receipt. If additional information is required to make a determination, the determination
date may be extended by 30 additional calendar days. We will mail you a written extension letter
before the expiration of the initial 30 calendar day.

We will send you our decision in a determination letter, which will include:
•   A statement of the provider's reconsideration request.
•   A statement of what action Wellpoint intends to take or has taken.
•   The reason for the action.
•   Support for the action, including applicable statutes, regulations, policies, claims, codes or
    provider manual references.
•   An explanation of the provider’s right to request a claim payment appeal within 30 calendar
    days of the date of the reconsideration determination letter.
•   An address to submit the claim payment appeal.
•   If the decision results in a claim adjustment, the payment and EOP will be sent separately.


5.14 Claim Payment Appeal

[Page 59]
This is the second step in the provider payment dispute process. If you disagree with the outcome of
the reconsideration, you may request an additional review as a claim payment appeal. A claim
payment dispute may be submitted for multiple reason(s) including:
•   Contractual payment issues.
•   Disagreements over reduced or zero-paid claims.
•   Post-service authorization issues.
•   Other health insurance denial issues.
•   Claim code editing issues.
•   Duplicate claim issues.
•   Claim data issues.
•   Timely filing issues.


If you are dissatisfied with the outcome of a reconsideration determination, you may submit a claim
payment appeal. We accept claim payment appeals through our provider website or in writing
within 30 calendar days of the date on the reconsideration determination letter, or 30 calendar
days of the date of the EOP if no reconsideration was requested previously. Claim payment appeals
received more than 30 calendar days after the claims reconsideration determination letter will be
considered untimely and upheld unless good cause can be established. When submitting a claim
payment appeal, please include as much information as you can to help us understand why you
think the reconsideration determination was in error. If a claim payment appeal requires clinical
expertise, it will be reviewed by appropriate clinical Wellpoint professionals.

Wellpoint will make every effort to resolve the claim payment appeal within 30 calendar days of
receipt. If additional information is required to make a determination, the determination date may
be extended by 30 additional calendar days. We will mail you a written extension letter before the
expiration of the initial 30 calendar days. We will send you our decision in a determination letter,
which will include:
•   A statement of the provider's claim payment appeal request.
•   A statement of what action Wellpoint intends to take or has taken.
•   The reason for the action.
•   Support for the action, including applicable statutes, regulations, policies, claims, codes or
    provider manual references.


If the decision results in a claim adjustment, the payment and EOP will be sent separately.


5.15 Claim Correspondence
Claim correspondence is different from a payment dispute. Correspondence is when we require
more information to finalize a claim. Typically, we make the request for this information through the

[Page 60]
EOP. The claim or part of the claim may, in fact, be denied, but it is only because more information is
required to process the claim. Once the information is received, we will use it to finalize the claim.

The following table provides examples of the most common correspondence issues along with
guidance on the most efficient ways to resolve them.

6. PROGRAM APPROACH AND RESOURCES
6.1 Best Practices for Medicaid Documentation
Thorough documentation is essential to ensuring continuity of care, providing accountability to
both the enrollee and the service provider, and providing the ability to track service outcomes and
enrollee progress.

Treatment Records
Wellpoint requires treatment records to be current, detailed and organized for effective, confidential
enrollee care and quarterly review. Your treatment records must conform to good professional
practice and be permanently maintained at the primary site.

Enrollees are entitled to one copy of their treatment record each year, and the copy is provided at
no cost to the enrollee. Enrollees or their representatives should have access to these records.

Please ensure that treatment records include:
•   Enrollee identification information shown on each page or electronic file
•   Personal/biographical data: age, sex, address, phone number(s)
•   Date and corroboration: dated and identified by the author
•   Legible to someone other than the author
•   Date, start time, end time and duration of services provided
•   Contains entries in the treatment record that are dated and include author identification (for
    example, handwritten signatures, unique electronic identifiers or initials)
•   Reflects all aspects of services.


Wellpoint may request that you submit additional documentation, including records or other
documentation not directly related to the enrollees, to support claims you submit. If documentation
is not provided following the request or notification, or if documentation does not support the
services billed for the services, we may:
•   Deny the claim.
•   Recover and/or recoup monies previously paid on the claim.


Wellpoint is not liable for interest or penalties when payment is denied or recouped because the
provider fails to submit required or requested documentation.

Assessments
Assessments are crucial for understanding the enrollee’s needs to inform the development of
the service/care plans.

[Page 63]
Service/Care Plans
Person-centered care plans are enrollee driven living documents that should be changed based on
enrollee needs, choices, strengths and goals. Each interaction with an enrollee should be informed
by their service/care plan for the sake of quality of care and providing a medically necessary
intervention.
Elements of a treatment plan include:
• Goals, objectives, and action steps that include enrollee and provider responsibility and target
   and completion date.
    −   Goals should be done in the SMART format, meaning that all goals are Specific, Measurable,
        Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound.
•   Enrollee strengths and barriers.
•   Members and parties of the enrollee’s support team, including natural supports.
•   Evidence that the enrollee is the primary author of the service/care plan, such as direct quotes
    from the enrollee, cultural and linguistic considerations and language that the enrollee uses
    and understands.
•   Clear medical necessity and reason for services/interventions.
•   Dated signatures of enrollee and service provider.
For service plan example template see Appendix C.

Person-centered planning will be documented into care plans, health need care plans, or
Supportive Housing/Supported Employment care plans. The overall success of care plan metrics will
be documented and reported in the Quality Assurance & Performance Improvement (QAPI). This will
include FCS provider findings such as:
•   An evaluation of the impact of interventions, including any planned follow-up actions or
    interventions.
•   A written assessment of the success of contractually required performance improvement
    projects.


Progress Notes
Each progress note must illustrate the enrollee’s story (medical necessity, goals, services and
interventions) on a standalone basis. It is helpful to utilize a template for documenting enrollee
interactions. The DARP (Description, Assessment, Response, Plan) format is commonly used and
contains all elements required for effective documentation. See each section detailed below.
• Description:
    −   Objective and factual observations.
        • Date, exact start and end times (not rounded), and location
        • Name of enrollee
        • Enrollee’s statements, behaviors, and relevant observations, including direct quotes and
          descriptions of the enrollee’s behavior.

[Page 64]
          •   For example, “Enrollee stated ‘I can’t stand my neighbor. He always gives me dirty
              looks.’” And “Enrollee was pacing back and forth and clenching their fists.”
    −   Subjective assessment of the service provider’s observations, including emotional state,
        progress towards service goals, and potential issues or barriers.
        • For example, “Client appears to be experiencing heightened anxiety, as evidenced by her
          body language. Client has expressed anxiety around interacting with her neighbors in the
          past, making statements like ‘I think they want me out of here.’”
•   Action: Detailing the interventions or actions taken by the service provider, including techniques
    used and issues and options discussed.
    −   For example, “Housing specialist discussed anxiety management techniques including deep
        breathing, coloring or drawing, and listening to calming music”.
•   Response: The enrollee’s response to the interventions and actions including verbal feedback,
    changes in mood or behavior, and nonverbal cues.
    −   For example, “Enrollee appeared open to the idea of using coloring pages as a relaxation
        strategy and asked if I could help her get some colored pencils and paper.”
•   Plan: Outlining the next steps, including follow-up appointments, goals, and future interventions.
    This will set a clear direction for the next interaction, thereby ensuring continuity of care.
    −   For example, “Our next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, June 3rd at 3pm at enrollee’s
        apartment. We will check in regarding the effectiveness of anxiety management
        techniques.”
    −   The plan section must also clearly tie the interaction back to a specific goal in the enrollee’s
        service/care plan. For example, if this enrollee’s goal is to feel comfortable in their
        apartment, the service provider might say, “Helping the enrollee find positive coping
        strategies for anxiety will help her feel comfortable in her apartment and more equipped to
        maintain her housing.”
Each progress note must have the dated signature, name, and title of the individual providing the
service.



6.2 Supportive Housing Services
Helping people with complex health needs live in the community means helping them take pride
in and responsibility for their homes and helping them choose the supportive services they need.
As such, educating tenants and increasing their involvement in planning are important to the
success of permanent Supportive Housing.

•   CSD guidelines


6.3 Supported Employment Services
The overriding philosophy of supported employment is the belief that every person with complex
health needs is capable of working competitively in the community if the right matching job and
work environment can be found. Rather than trying to sculpt enrollees into becoming perfect
workers, extensive prevocational assessment as systematic job development is used to offer
enrollees help finding and keeping jobs that capitalize on their personal strengths and motivation.
Thus, the primary goal of supported employment is not to change enrollees but to find a natural fit
between enrollees’ strengths and experiences and jobs in the community.

7. TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
The FCS Transition Assistance Program (TAP) is a program designed to support Foundational
Community Supports Supportive Housing (FCS-SH) enrollees. It is a time-limited, flexible funding
assistance that covers housing-related fees, including short-term rents, move-in costs, and non-
refundable fees. TAP aligns with the Community Behavioral Health Rental Assistance program
(CBRA), Section 8 (project-based and Housing Choice Voucher), and other longer-term rental
assistance programs.

8. APPLE HEALTH AND HOMES RENTAL ASSISTANCE
PROGRAM
The Apple Health and Homes Rental Assistance Program (AHAH-RAP) connects supportive housing
support services with rental assistance. A drawing will be conducted for an opportunity to provide
selected awardees with a chance to receive a Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) voucher
through the Department of Commerce Office of Apple Health and Homes Permanent Supportive
Housing (AHAH-PSH).

As the Coordinating Entity, Wellpoint acts as an intermediary between an FCS provider and
Department of Commerce Office of AHAH-PSH. Commerce is the payer of rental assistance.

8.1 Eligibility
An individual must meet all the following AHAH criteria to be eligible for AHAH-RAP as stated in
RCW 74.09.886:
• 18 years or older
•   Active FCS-eligible Medicaid. See the FCS Medicaid Eligibility Check at
    WAWA_WLP_CAID_FCSMedicaidEligibilityCheck.pdf (Wellpoint.com)
•   Authorized by Wellpoint to receive FCS supportive housing services under one of the following
    risk factors:
    ‒   Chronic homelessness
    ‒   Frequent or lengthy institutional contacts
    ‒   Frequent adult residential care stays
•   Experiencing homelessness as defined in RCW 43.185c.010


8.2 Rental Assistance Subsidy
The AHAH Rental Assistance Program Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (TBRA) voucher will cover up
to 130% of Fair Market Rent (*FMR). The awardee is responsible for approximately 30% of their
income towards their monthly rent. The subsidy covers the remainder of the monthly rent. The AHAH
Rental Assistance Program (AHAH-RAP) awardees aren’t required to have an income to be eligible
for AHAH-RAP.

8.3 Drawing
FCS-SH providers will work with their FCS-SH AHAH-eligible enrollees to complete an AHAH
Assessment. The AHAH Assessment provides additional information about the person and their
current circumstances. Wellpoint is incorporating the AHAH Assessment questions into the FCS-SH
Assessment.

       into the current Supportive Housing assessment).
